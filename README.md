# C0D3 SPR1T3S(CODE SPRITES)
## Bringing easily editable 2D array pixelized images to the world of programmers!
### About CODE SPRITES
CODE SPRITES, is an open-source website. That's right, it's an open source website. If that's not crazy, I don't know what is! The goal of CODE SPRITES is to give easily editable and drawable sprites to the world of programmers and graphics designers. All we(I) ask is that you give credit to the website and any users who made the sprites (unless they say they don't want any)
Here's an example:
`/*
Item sprites from https://candiedsites.github.io/CODE-SPRITES/CandiedHat.
Thanks Candied Hat!
*/`
### Want to help? There's always room for one more in cyberspace!
Want to help? Don't want to help? Please do! we(I) are(am) working hard here, and I would LOVE some help. If you want to contribute sprites, help make the website, or even be our QA(or Q&A) team, you're always welcome to join! All you are required to do is create a GitHub account! (You should probably have some past knowledge and/or experience in the field you'll be helping with).
### Offline site
I don't know WHY you'd want to, but I wont ask. If you want to have this website offline, just download the .zip or .tar.gz folder and open the `index.html` file. It's that easy! Seriously though, what's the point of having a website like this offline? Oh well, I guess you have some reason...
#### Happy Coding!
