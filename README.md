## Bringing easily editable 2D array pixelized images to the world of programmers!
### About CODE SPRITES
CODE SPRITES, is an open-source website with a goal to provide amazing tools for creating pixelized images for your retro games and art! When it is released, you will be able to go to the site and take any of the 2D array images and color palletes for FREE! All we'll ask is that you give credit to the user who uploaded it, and to the code sprites website (e.g., pixel images from codespritewebsite.domain/userwhomademariosprites and codespritewebsite.domain/userwhomadebowsersprites).
### Want to help? There's always room for one more in cyberspace!
While the team creating this IS led by a 12 year old boy, that 12 year old boy has a passion for coding. If you want to help make the website, be a beta tester, or contribute sprites before the release of the website, all you have to do is ask! (Team members will be expected to contribute to the website or give reason for not contributing at least once a week. This isn't an official job and you will not have work hours or be given pay for your work.)
#### Happy Coding!
