        <h3>About <code>CODE SPRITES</code></h3>
        <p>Code sprites is a website dedicated to providing easy to use pixelated sprites to the world of game designers and programmers. We make simple 2D arrays that can easily be converted to or used in different languages, with no ugly <code>.png</code> or <code>.jp[e]g</code> images. 2D arrays have many advantages over images. While they can take longer to load, in some cases they are more efficient. As well, 2D array sprites can be easily edited within their code. These 2D arrays can be processed by simple functions, which will be provided on this site, and then called as images within your code! As well, these are possible to use on websites like Khan Academy, where most outside images aren't allowed.</p>
